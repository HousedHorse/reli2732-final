## Kübler-Ross’ Five Stages of Grief 

- Stages of someone who is dying or mourning
  - ex: loss of job, death
1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining
  - Bargain with a higher power to influence the outcome
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

- **Major critique**
  - It presumes a unified character of grief (sequential)
  - That every person grieves the same way (normative) 

## Bonanno’s Theory of grief

- Grief doesn't follow a linear sequence
- **Found that there are 3 general apporaches to grief**
  - Chronic grief
    - No matter how hard or much time has passed, the grief continues to feel
    like an open wound
    - They never get over it
  -Recovery Pattern
    - After around a year the individual gradually begins to recover and return
    to the moderate life satisfaction
    - Even thogh they are healthy they still hurt years later
  -Recsilience Pattern
    - Grief hits them hard, buth then as time passes they find a way to adapt to 
    the loss
    - It's not that they don't care they put the pain aside to meet the demands 
    of life

## Lifton and Olson on “Symbolic Immortality” 

- The fear of death is a drive
- Humans feel a drive of continuity, that they will survive this present moment
- A quest for some symbolic immortality since humans deal with the existential
fear of death

  - We don't think of the death of our love ones

    meditation, psychedelic drugs, etc. 
  - Redefines how death is seen or interpreted

## 20th- and 21st-century changes in Canadian approaches to (and understandings of) death

## The “phase of negated death,” 

- The liminal state between the death of the individual and their funeral service
- The deceased person is in a liminal state of death and life
- Similar to chinese ritual of calling back the dead
  - Similar ritual of ressucitaion to try to bring the person back even if they
  are dead
  - Once it is clear they're not coming back to life their body is washed by family
  or a professional (medicalization)
  - There's a wake where the funeral is going to be carried out
  - The deceased person is talked to like they are alive
    - Their spirit is still there
## Muen
- "Without bonds," "Without ties"
- The fear of "muen"
  - The fear of being forgotten

  - A grave that no longer has a bond (not being paid for by a family) stays 
  there for a certain amount of years
  - Afterwards dugged up and the body is placed in an ossuary
  - Then the grave can be used by another family


## The similarities and differences between funerary practice in contemporary Canada and Japan (case study)

- The cost of a funeral in Japan is the same as a reasonable quality car
