# 21st Century Canada

## Kübler-Ross’ Five Stages of Grief

- Stages of someone who is dying or mourning
    - ex: loss of job, death
1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining
    - Bargain with a higher power to influence the outcome
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

- **Major critique**
    - It presumes a unified character of grief (sequential)
    - That every person grieves the same way (normative)

## Bonanno’s Theory of grief

- Grief doesn't follow a linear sequence
- **Found that there are 3 general apporaches to grief**
    - Chronic grief
        - No matter how hard or much time has passed, the grief continues to feel
        like an open wound
        - They never get over it
    - Recovery Pattern
        - After around a year the individual gradually begins to recover and return
        to the moderate life satisfaction
        - Even though they are healthy they still hurt years later
    - Resilience Pattern
        - Grief hits them hard, but then as time passes they find a way to adapt to
        the loss
        - It's not that they don't care they put the pain aside to meet the demands
        of life

## Lifton and Olson on “Symbolic Immortality”

- The fear of death is a drive
- Humans feel a drive of continuity, that they will survive this present moment
- A quest for some symbolic immortality since humans deal with the existential
fear of death
- One major features of 21st Century Canada is that our culture is death denying
    - We don't think of the death of our love ones

1. Biological immortality -> AKA biosocial immortality
2. Creative immortality
    - Can achieve immortality through arts. An art so great your name lives on
    - ex: symphonies, paintings
3. Theological immortality
    - Take on another form after death varying on your belief/religion
4. Natural immortality
    - The idea that we're apart of a natural cycle
    - We live than die and our bodies go back into the earth, to the natural world
5. Experiential immortality
    - The idea that there are certain experiences can be reached through
        meditation, psychedelic drugs, etc.
    - Redefines how death is seen or interpreted

## The Most Common Causes of Death in the 21st Century

- Cancer
- Major cause of the rise of cancer because humans live longer
    - Therefore affects more older people

## Bill C-14

- In 2016 allows physician assisted suicide
- Under this laws nurse practitioners or    physicians may provide a substance to end
their own life
- You need to be covered under Canadian healthcare
    - To avoid foreign nationals coming to Canada for the purpose of dying
- Need to be 18
- Need to have a grievance and irredeemable condition
- Need to give conform consent

## 20th- and 21st-century changes in Canadian approaches to (and understandings of) death

- Medicalization
    - The removal of death from a familial personal context to an institutional
    medical one
    - For the majority of Canadians 78% were dying in hospitals (1944)
- Professionalization
    - The removal of family with managing death and all those responsibilities
    are now on professionals
    - The preparing/cleaning of the body is not done by family members anymore
    - Now done by institutional workers
- Bureaucratization
    - The laws and procedures that surrounds death in Canada

## Disenfranchised Grief

- The death of someone you had an affair with for example is not acknowledged
    - Their grief is not supported by society
    - Their ability to grieve is not given its full weight
    - Jensen's grandmother had Alzheimer's and had no way to express grief since
    she was still alive
        - Only other people who have gone through that can understand
        - ex: disenfranchised grief

## The “phase of negated death,”

- The liminal state between the death of the individual and their funeral service
- The deceased person is in a liminal state of death and life
- Similar to Chinese ritual of calling back the dead
    - Similar ritual of resuscitation to try to bring the person back even if they
    are dead
    - Once it is clear they're not coming back to life their body is washed by family
    or a professional (medicalization)
    - There's a wake where the funeral is going to be carried out
    - The deceased person is talked to like they are alive
        - Their spirit is still there

## Muen
- "Without bonds," "Without ties"
- The fear of "muen"
    - The fear of being forgotten
- In Japan you don't buy a grave, you lease it
    - A grave that no longer has a bond (not being paid for by a family) stays
    there for a certain amount of years
    - Afterwards dug up and the body is placed in an ossuary
    - Then the grave can be used by another family


## The similarities and differences between funerary practice in contemporary Canada and Japan (case study)

- The cost of a funeral in Japan is the same as a reasonable quality car
- We distance ourselves from the dead
