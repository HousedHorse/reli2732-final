## The Three Paths to Liberation in the Bhagavad Gita

- soteriology
- liberation = moksha

1. path of action (karma yoga)
    - not tied to wordly desires
    - think of actions as sacrifice
    - act in accordance with dharma
1. path of knowledge (jnana yoga)
    - direct experience of the divine
    - requires an enlightened teacher
1. path of devotional love (bhakti yoga)
    - development of a personal relationship between individual and the divine
    - most accessible of the three
    - worship with single-minded loving devotion
    - surrender onto will of the brahman
    - open to women as well as men

## Symbolism of the Rite of Renunciation (reading)

- fake cremation
- discard novice robes
- cleanse self in the river
- "reborn" as sannyasan (one who follows sannyasa, renunciant)
- their body will no longer be burned when they die
