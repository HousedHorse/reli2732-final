34. Identify the tradition associated with the following passage:

> [Yama:] Fools dwelling in ignorance, yet imagining themselves wise and learned, go round and round in crooked ways, like the blind led by the blind. The Hereafter never rises before the thoughtless child (the ignorant), deluded by the glamour of wealth. “This world alone is, there is no other”: thinking thus, he falls under my sway again and again.
> He about whom many are not even able to comprehend after hearing: wonderful is the teacher, wonderful is he who can receive when taught by an able teacher. When taught by a man of inferior understanding, this Atman cannot be truly known, even though frequently taught upon. There is no way (to know It) unless it is taught by another (an illumined teacher), for it is subtler than the subtle and beyond argument. O dearest, this Atman cannot be attained by argument; It is truly known only when taught by another (a wise teacher). O Nachiketas, those hast attained It. Thou art fixed in Truth. May we ever find a questioner like thee. (...)

> [Yama] The wise, who by means of the highest meditation on the Self knows the Ancient One, difficult to perceive, seated in the innermost recess, hidden in the cave of the heart, dwelling in the depth of inner being, (he knows the One) as God, is liberated from the fetters of joy and sorrow. A mortal, having heard and fully grasped this, and having realized through discrimination this subtle Self, rejoices, because he has obtained that which is the source of all joy. I think the abode (of Truth) is open to Nachiketas.

This Word is indeed Brahman. This Word is indeed Supreme. He who knows this Word obtains whatever he desires. This is the best Support, This is the highest Support; he who knows this Support is glorified in the world of Brahman.
> The Self is not born, nor does It die. It did not spring from anything, nor did anything spring from It. This Ancient One is unborn, eternal, everlasting. It is not slain even though the body is slain.

40. Identify the tradition associated with the following passage:

> “O Arjuna, how can a person who knows that the Atman is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and imperishable, kill anyone or cause anyone to be killed? Just as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old ones, similarly Atman acquires new bodies after casting away the old bodies. …  The Atman is said to be unmanifest, unthinkable, and unchanging. Knowing this Atman as such you should not grieve. If you think that this (body) takes birth and dies perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. Because, death is certain for the one who is born, and birth is certain for the one who dies. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable.

If you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your duty, lose your reputation, and incur sin.
> People will talk about your disgrace forever. … You will go to heaven if killed, or you will enjoy the earth if victorious. Therefore, get up with a determination to fight, O Arjuna. Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty. By doing your duty this way you will not incur sin”
