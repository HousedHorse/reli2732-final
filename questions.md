Therefore, a monk should not form excessive attachment with regard to a possession. That to which such an attachment arises is to be discarded. If one does not discard it, he comes to be guilty of an offense. But if a sick person asks for one of his own belongings, it should indeed be very quickly given to him by the attendant monk. If one does not give it, he comes to be guilty of an offense.” (494-495)

In this capacity one day he pursued bandits to Mount Zhong, where they smote him and wounded him on the brow. He took off his seal and bound himself up with its ribbon. Notwithstanding, he died soon after.
> When the First Ruler of Wu took the throne, one of Wen’s former officers met Wen on the road riding a white horse, carrying a white feather fan, and followed by the retinue he always had. This frightened the officer, so he fled. Wen pursued him and said: “I wish to be the local deity of his region and can bring blessings to your people. You must make it known among the citizens that should they not build me a temple, ill-fortune will overtake them.” That very summer there was a great pestilence. The commoners frightened one another with their fears, and not a few secretly began to make fainthearted offerings to Wen.

They died, and no physician could cure them. Commoners grew more fearful, but Sun, Ruler of Wu, did not believe the agent was Wen. So again Wen descended into a medium and uttered a curse, “If you do not make sacrifice to me, I shall send a scourge of fire.”
> That very year great fires broke out - sometimes several score places in a single day and began threatening the palace itself. The persons Sun consulted felt Wen’s spirit had come back again and to prevent further damage it should be mollified.
> Therefore, emissaries were sent to make Ziwen posthumously Duke of Zhongdu, and his younger brother, Zixu, was made God Commander of Changshui. Each was given a seal of office, and a temple was erected.

Natural ways of glorification such as these are endlessly repeated. All the devas bring with them a hundred thousand flowers, pieces of aromatic wood, and thousands of musical instruments to use as offerings to the Buddha and the assembly of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas; they scatter flowers, diffuse perfumes everywhere, and play various kinds of music. They come and go in succession, giving way to each other. At such times their joy and happiness are beyond description

At once they will be born by transformation spontaneously from within seven-jeweled lotus flowers. They will dwell in the stage of non-retrogression, attain steadfast wisdom, and be capable of freely exercising supernatural powers. For this reason, Ānanda, sentient beings who wish to see Amitāyus while in this world should awaken aspiration for highest enlightenment, perform meritorious deeds, and aspire to be born in his land.”
